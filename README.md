This study develops input devices for EMG signal detection, signal analysis and signal model development, and
It focuses on developing applications for signal processing.
The input device for detecting EMG signals is a sensor for detecting EMG signals on the wrist and arm
It must be able to attach and transmit signals obtained through wireless communication to the mobile environment
All.
Next, it should be able to detect which action the obtained signal corresponds to. Commands in advance
A hand motion model is generated by detecting and analyzing a hand motion signal for. Characteristics of the generated signal
The characteristics of the corresponding operation are machine-learned by setting marks and parameters. After that, the user's operation
When a signal is received, it is determined which behavior corresponds to this model and mobile language
It is used in the application.
Finally, the detected signal should be able to be processed in a mobile environment. Mobile conversion in real time
Develop an application that analyzes the signal in Gyeong and performs the corresponding function. Input device
Simple game functions to familiarize yourself with the manipulation of the device, remotely without direct manipulation of the device
Remote shooting function that can support single-person media production by manipulating images, muscles during exercise
It can support exercise analysis functions that measure imbalance and muscle fatigue.
