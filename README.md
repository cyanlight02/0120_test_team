# SEMG-Application-Sensor-Project

This study focuses on the development of input devices for EMG signal detection, signal analysis and signal model development, and applications for signal processing.

The input device for detecting an EMG signal should be able to attach a sensor for detecting an EMG signal to the wrist and arm and transmit the signal obtained through it to the mobile environment through wireless communication.

Next, it should be possible to detect which operation the obtained signal corresponds to.

A hand motion model is generated by detecting and analyzing the hand motion signal for a command in advance.

The characteristics of the corresponding operation are machine-learned by setting the feature points and parameters of the generated signal. After that, when the user's motion signal is input, it is compared with this model and used in the mobile application.

Finally, the detected signal must be able to be processed in a mobile environment. Develop an application that analyzes signals in a mobile environment in real-time and performs a corresponding function.

It would be able to support a simple game function to get used to the operation of an input device, a remote shooting function that can support one-person media production by filming an image by remotely operating a device without direct device operation, and an exercise analysis function that measures muscle imbalance and muscle fatigue during exercise.
